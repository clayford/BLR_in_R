## CODE ALONG 1
- create a cross tabulation of admit and died
- Plot `died` as a function of `systolic`.


xtabs(~ admit + died, data = icu)
plot(died ~ systolic, data = icu)

## CODE ALONG 2

- Model died as a function of age, cancer, admit and uncons. Save the model as `m2`.
- Use `summary()` and `confint()` on the model
- Interpret the coefficient for admit as an odds ratio
- What's the predicted probability of dying for a person age 50 with cancer, Emergency admission, and unconscious?

m2 <- glm(died ~ age + cancer + admit + uncons, data = icu, 
          family = binomial)
summary(m2)
confint(m2)
predict(m2, newdata = data.frame(age = 50, cancer = "Yes", 
                                 admit = "Emergency", uncons = "Yes"),
        type = "response")
        
## CODE ALONG 3

Assess model `m2` using the methods we just described.

anova(m2, test = "Chisq")
LRstats(m2)


## CODE ALONG 4

- Fit a new model with the following formula and save as `m3`. (Systolic is the systolic blood pressure at admission): 
  `died ~ age + cancer + admit + uncons + systolic + age:systolic`   
- Does the interaction seem necessary?
- Visualize the interaction.

Add a new R code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* (Win/Linux) or *Cmd+Option+I* (Mac).


m3 <- glm(died ~ age + cancer + systolic + admit + uncons + age:systolic,
          data = icu, family = binomial)
Anova(m3)

Effect(c("systolic", "age"), mod = m3) |> 
         plot()


## CODE ALONG 5

- Fit a new model that uses all predictors and the age:systolic interaction: `died ~ . + age:systolic`. Call the model `m6`.
- Compare model `m6` to `m3` using the `LRstats()` and `anova()` functions. Why is it OK to use the `anova()` function?
- Check for influential observations using the `influencePlot()` function. Save the result as `infl_m6`.


m6 <- glm(died ~ . + age:systolic, data = icu, family = binomial)
summary(m6)
LRstats(m3, m6)
anova(m3, m6, test = "Chisq")
infl_m6 <- influencePlot(m6)
predict(m6, type = "response")["154"]
icu["154",]
